Deadlock:
---------
    Deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting
    for each other to release a resource. This typically occurs when two or more threads have a cicular
    dependencies on a set of locks.


    Deadlock typically occurs when four conditions are met simultaneously:

        --> Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread can access one resource at a time.
        --> Hold and wait: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire
                           additional resource held by another threads.
        --> No Preemption: Resource cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them.
        --> Circular wait: A Set of threads is waiting for each other in a circular wait.
